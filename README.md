# Cyclistic_case_study
## Introduction
For the capstone project, I have selected the cyclistic Bike Share analysis case study to work on. 
I will work as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
