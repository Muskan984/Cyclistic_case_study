# Cyclistic_case_study
## Introduction
For the capstone project, I have selected the Cyclistic Bike Share analysis case study to work on. 
I will perform the case study as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
- Detailed documentation of SQL code is available on GitHub.
- Initial analysis of dataset provided by Cyclistic using MS-Excel.
- Data cleaning, manipulation and exploration using MS-SQL.
- Data Visualization using Tableau Public.
