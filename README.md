# Cyclistic_case_study
## Introduction
### For the capstone project, I have selected the cyclistic Bike Share analysis case study to work on. I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior
data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,
share, and act.
